## My lackluster origin story
I grew up rather reluctant to move. I was the kind of kid to stay indoors- reading, daydreaming, watching cartoons, or exercising my thumbs playing Pokemon on a Nintendo DS. Also, I'm categorically bad at sports. 

For someone who voluntarily avoids physical activity, I never imagined I would love dancing. I was 13 when I discovered K-pop, which sparked my interest in movement. I was increasingly drawn to this genre because the dancing looked cool and expressive, albeit corny at times. As an Asian-American, I greatly appreciated how Asian idols defied the stereotypes of Asians being geeky, awkward, unattractive, or lacking personality. 

I kept my burgeoning interest in dance a secret from everyone, especially from my family. I thought I would be laughed at if anyone in my family knew how interested I was in dancing. So I didn't dance at all (except for occasional attemps at arm waves using the bathroom mirror).

Throughout my teenage years and 20s, I regularly consumed dance content but I didn't really start learning dance until January 2021, at the age of 25. I enrolled at Steezy Studio, an online platform for hermits like me to wiggle around in the comfort of our homes. I started out learning a few choreographed hip-hop routines, flailing around alone in the garage. Eventually, I found house dance and now I regularly practice house 5 or 6 days a week. 

## Dancing despite insecurities 
I wish I could say that I was dedicated to dance from 2021 to today. But I often let my insecurities get the better of me. A lot of things come up for me when I dance, especially my insecurities around being incompetent and lacking cooridination, rhythm, and confidence.

It's easy for me to drown in a stream of negative thinking. _I'm too old to dance. I started too late. I have no talent. I should give up._ Sometimes, the onslaught of shame is so loud and I can't seem to find the volume knob. But if I slow down and bring my mind back into my body, I feel better, by at least a quarter turn of the dial. 

I've had success of varying degrees with meditation, diet cleansing, and other self-help life hacks. But so far, the easiest way for me to breathe through my insecurities is through **slow movement**. Slow running, slow qigong exercises, and slow practice of dance moves have all helped me observe my thoughts and let them be. 

I'm 29 now and I feel pressure to enter my thirties as someone who has more of her life sorted out. I have no ducks and no rows. I have no real plans. But in the meantime, I will keep dancing. My hope is to dance for as long as I am able to. 

## Blogging for learning 

Although experience is a wonderful teacher, I've never been able to learn a darn thing the first time around. Learning for me requires a long gestation period, for repetition and reflection. I'm starting this blog because I want to document what I'm learning in dance, slow movement, and life in general. I find the poem "For a New Beginning" apt, excerpt below. 

>Though your destination is not yet clear
><br>You can trust the promise of this opening;
><br>Unfurl yourself into the grace of beginning
><br>That is at one with your lifeâ€™s desire.
>
>Awaken your spirit to adventure;
><br>Hold nothing back, learn to find ease in risk;
><br>Soon you will be home in a new rhythm,
><br>For your soul senses the world that awaits you.
>
><br>\- John O' Donohue
